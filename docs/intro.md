# Introduction

<!-- Content -->
This project is created for learning, teaching, and sharing resources around Solidity. The idea is cover concepts from functions to layer-2 solution to zero-knowledge-proofs and more. An attempt to teach people Solidity regardless of their experience level. While writing this this, efforts are made to make it really friendly for individuals who are not from technical/software development background. Having said that, having basic programming in any language would make it easier to follow along.

### What do you need ?

1. Web browser. We are going to use a browser based IDE, [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to get used to language and start writing contracts. We will avoid dealing with compilers, tools, and development environment until basics are covered.

2. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. (it's free)
   
3. An appetite to learn (and maybe some coffee to support the stereotype).

### Get in touch.

Feel free to  connect via our [Github Repo](https://github.com/PradhumnaPancholi/solidity-cookbook) if you face any issues, questions, or just want to get in touch.
