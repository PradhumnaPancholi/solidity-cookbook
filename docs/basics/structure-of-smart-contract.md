# Structure of a smart contract

Now, we will start writing a smart contract and understand the structure of a contract and its fundamental components as we go.

As discussed in the previous module, we will be keeping all of our code in one directory on Remix IDE. I have named it "Cookbook" but you can name it whatever you want. Go ahead and create a file "Greet.sol", we are going to create a simple smart-contract. You will be exposed to the concepts of functions, variables, events,etc. However, the first contract is going to be relatively simpler so you can get a hang of it before we write a complete dApp.

Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. Each contract can contain declarations of State Variables, Functions, Function Modifiers, Events, Errors, Struct Types and Enum Types. Furthermore, contracts can inherit from other contracts.

There are also special kinds of contracts called libraries and interfaces.

The section about contracts contains more details than this section, which serves to provide a quick overview.
