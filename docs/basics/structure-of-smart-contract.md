# Structure of a smart contract

Now, we will start writing a smart contract and understand the structure of a contract and its fundamental components as we go.

As discussed in the previous module, we will be keeping all of our code in one directory on Remix IDE. I have named it "Cookbook" but you can name it whatever you want. Go ahead and create a file "Greet.sol", we are going to create a simple smart-contract. You will be exposed to the concepts of functions, variables, events,etc. However, the first contract is going to be relatively simpler so you can get a hang of it before we write a complete dApp.
