# Solidity Cookbook
This project is created for learning, teaching, and sharing resources about Solidity. 

We will cover concepts such as `functions`, `layer-2 solutions`, `zero-knowledge-proofs`, and more. 

This is an attempt to teach Solidity regardless of your level of coding experience: effort is being made to make it really friendly for individuals who are **not from technical/software development backgrounds**. Having said that, having basic programming in any language would make it easier to follow along.

#### Create a branch

Here's an example of what branches will look like.

[author-name]/[type of contribution]/[commit-name]

1. Author-Name:  This is going to be your name or initial in github. For example, I use "pnp" as my initials.
2. Type of Contribution: As it says, it's going to be type of contribution that you are working on. It will be one of the following.
   1. feature -  for adding a feature for website which is not a UI change or addition/modification in content.
   2. ui - for making changes to styling, theme, templates, pages, etc.
   3. bug -  for solution of a bug
   4. hotfix - for temp branches to implement quick fixes. 
   5. add - for adding a module/lesson about Solidity.
   6. mod - for modifying an existing module/lesson.
3. Commit name:  Name of commit. For example, "functions-lesson". Make sure to use hyphen for separating words.

For example the new update you want to make is `small-improvement-in-readme`. You can replace the branch name with your own preferred branch name.
This creates and gets you working on a separate branch.
```bash
git checkout -b small-improvement-in-readme
```
